\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
The goal of this paper is to provide:
Visualizations of trades over time that enforce the concepts about diversification and risk mitigation explored in the paper
Give a better understanding on where individuals can begin to get into stock trading without the worry (maybe start with the SP 500 and choose stocks from there?)

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Interest}

Explain why this interection of fiance and combinatorics is crucial for risk management and investment strategies.

\subsection{Brief History}

Introdfuce the evolution of graph theory applications in financial markets. 

\subsection{Motivation}

Discuss why modern porfolio theory benefits from advanced mathematical tools such as combinatorics and graph theory.

\section{Background}

This is the first part of the main body of the paper. Here you will define the key concepts and terms that will be used throughout the paper.

\subsection{Definitions}

% Extremal Graph Theory

\begin{theorem}[Extremal Graph Theorem]
    Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Then, if $G$ does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $K_{r+1}$, the complete graph on $r+1$ vertices, then $m \leq \frac{r}{2}(n-1)$.
\end{theorem}

% Spearman Rank Coefficent

\begin{definition}[Spearman Rank Coefficent]
\end{definition}

\[
\rho = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
\]

Go into detail about the spearman rank coefficent

% Greedy Coloring Algorithm

\begin{definition}[Welsch-Powwell Algorithm]
\end{definition}

Go into detail about the coloring alogirthm



Briefly define graph theory terms that will be used (vertices, edges, etc.). 


Convert the concept of a portfolio from a spreadsheet to a graph with vertices and edges. This concept is the central point of the paper.


\subsection{Data Collection and Processing}

For the purpose of this project, I took the time to develop a custom API that allows me to quickly export historical data for a given stock\footnote{Full documentation and a link to the source code of the custom API can be found on my website, linked in the references section.}. The API contains an endpoint that allows users to generate a CSV file for any given stock ticker and date range, providing 20 years of historical data. The benefit of developing a custom API is that it allows the developer full control over data-cleaning and preparation on the server side to enforce uniformity and ease-of-use. The fields we are going to use are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \bf{Date} - The date of the stock price. 
    \item \bf{Open} - The opening price of the stock on that date.
    \item \bf{High} - The highest price the stock reached on that date.
    \item \bf{Low} - The lowest price the stock reached on that date.
    \item \bf{Close} - The closing price of the stock on that date.
    \item \bf{Volume} - The number of shares traded on that date.
\end{itemize}

\section{Portfolio Optimization}

Optimization and Diversification
Extremal Graph Theory

\begin{itemize}
    \item Theoretical Framework: Explain the extremal graph theorem.
    \item Application: Demonstrate how this theorem can predict the maximum or minimum number of edges under certain conditions, which translates to understanding the limits of diversification in a portfolio.
    \item Examples: Provide hypothetical examples of portfolios and how the theorem applies.
\end{itemize}


% [Main Section]
\section{Risk Assessment}
Coloring algorithms for risk assesment and management

\begin{itemize}
    \item Concept Introduction: Explain what graph coloring is and the significance of using different colors.
    \item Implementation: How coloring can be used to represent different levels of risk or different asset classes.
    \item Practical Example: A case study where coloring helps in decision-making about asset allocation or identifying over-concentrated sectors
\end{itemize}

\section{Holding Vizualization}

Correlation Graphs for Portfolio Holdings

\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph Construction: Discuss how to build a graph where vertices represent assets and edges represent correlations between returns.
    \item Analysis Techniques: Use threshold levels to add/remove edges or use weights to show the strength of correlations.
    \item Visualization: Include a section on how these graphs can visually represent portfolio diversification and the interconnections between assets.
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary: Recap how graph theory enhances portfolio management.
    \item Future Directions: Suggest how further research could integrate other combinatorial techniques or advanced graph theory concepts.
    \item Open Problems: Pose any unresolved questions or potential for new research that your paper hints at.
\end{itemize}
